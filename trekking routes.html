	<h1>Annapurna Circuit</h1>
	<p>The legendary Annapurna region is the most diverse and popular trekking area in Nepal. From the full three-week 
	Annapurna Circuit, which stretches into the historic Mustang region to short three-day treks, there's a trek suitable 
	for everyone here. As the name suggests, the centre piece of this part of Nepal is the range of mountains that includes 
	Annapurna I, the first of the 8,000 m peaks to be climbed. Also included in this region is yet another 8,000 m giant, 
	Dhaulagiri, which is located west of Annapurna I.Between these two mountains lies the valley of the Kali-Gandaki River, 
	the deepest gorge in the world. Trekkers encounter the interesting Thakali people in this region. They are known for being 
	good in business ventures and their home cooking is relished by both tourists and the Nepali people in general.</p></div>

   <h1>Mardi Himal </h1>
	<p>Fantastic Mardi Himal Trek is located just east of one of the most legendary trekking destination of Nepal, the Annapurna
 Base Camp trek. Mardi Himal trek is an unseen gem yet. Few trekkers make their way to the Mardi Himal Base Camp outstandingly 
 positioned at the base of Mardi Himal and the Annapurna region´s most iconic mount Machapuchhre literally meaning "Fish tail".
 The trail goes along small winding paths, through enchanted rhododendron forests until you climb out of the forest at an 
 elevation around 3,300 meter. The landscape changes quite abruptly into a rugged high mountain landscape, with amazing views 
 of Mardi Himal, Machapuchre, Annapurna South and Hiunchuli.</p></div>

<h1>Everest Base Camp</h1>
   <p>Everest is more than a mountain and the journey to its base camp is more than just a trek. Along a route dubbed by some 
   as "the steps to heaven," every bend in the trail provides another photo opportunity — beautiful forests, Sherpa villages, 
   glacial moraines, and foothills. For active adventurers not afraid to break a sweat, our full trekking support staff will 
   bring you close to local cultures before opening a window to the top of the world.The trek to Everest Base Camp is among 
   the most dramatic and picturesque in the Himalaya. The scenery is varied and spectacular, the lodgings and tracks are of a 
   very high standard, and the interaction with the local Sherpa people is truly memorable.</p></div>

 <div class="box8">	  
<h1>Langtang Trek</h1>
      <p>Despite being very close to the Kathmandu valley, Langtang is a splendid trekking area with treks ranging between 7 
	  to 10 days. The Langtang trek starts with the forest line and goes all the way up to the alpine line to its range of 
	  plus 7000 meters of snow capped Himalayan Peaks.This area is a fine choice for those who want an alpine trek, yet do not 
	  have time for a longer trek in for example the Everest region. In this vast mountain scape, you trek through remote 
	  villages, with a touch of Tibet that borders not far north from here. You cross flower, meadows, enjoy the view to 
	  rugged peaks and if in spring, the splendours of rhodenderon in flower.The Langtang Valley has long been a favorite 
	  trek due to its expansive views, interesting Tamang culture, relatively gentle pace and accessibility from Kathmandu. 
	  The 2015 earthquake and subsequent landslide had an enormous effect on the region, but aid and reconstruction have 
	  recently reopened this valley to trekking again. Not only is it still a beautiful trek, your visit will also provide 
	  vital support for local livelihoods.</p></div>
